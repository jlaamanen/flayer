# Flayer example

This is an example project that demonstrates Flayer's basic functionalities.

### Client

Svelte TypeScript template.

Start with:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Server

Node.js with TypeScript, nodemon and Flayer.

Start with:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Server-pkg

Package generated by Flayer.

## Features

- **Sessions** for handling authentication.
- **Simple CRUD functions** for viewing and editing the products list.
- **Authorization** via simple "assertion" functions (`assertIsLoggedIn`, `assertIsAdmin`), that use sessions to check if the user has rights to do what they're trying to do.
- **Serialization** to handle product serialization/deserialization under the hood. The dates just work.
- Even a **callback function** is passed to server-side functions to subscribe to real-time changes to any products. Open the app in two browsers to see how they stay in sync.
